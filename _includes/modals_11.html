                          <p>This indicator tracks the status of national seed policy instruments. It focuses only on the presence and
                            completeness of these instruments, and not on their implementation. It is scored based on expert opinion
                            and given a rating from 0 to 10. For a country to achieve a score of 8 to 10, all relevant policy instruments
                            should have been enacted by the relevant government entities. A score of 6 to less than 8 indicates that
                            most seed policy instruments are in place and that they are up to date. For a score of 4 to less than 6, a
                            fair number of seed policy instruments must be in place. For a score of 2 to less than 4, insufficient policy
                            instruments are in place, which may, moreover, be outdated. For a score of 0 to less than 2, seed policy
                            instruments are in draft mode. A country with no seed policy instruments at all scores 0.</p>
