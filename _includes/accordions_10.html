      <p>This indicator tracks the extent to which seed is available in small packages, which
        tend to be more suitable and affordable for small-scale farmers. Small packages
        may also help increase adoption rates of improved seed among this group. Data
        sources are TASAI reports, seed industry experts, national seed authorities, and
        national seed associations.
