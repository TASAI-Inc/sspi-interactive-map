      <p>This indicator tracks the clarity of seed import regulations and the consistency of their enforcement. The
        indicator was scored based on expert opinion on the clarity of import processes and the consistency of the
        enforcement of import regulations.10 In addition, data were collected on the volume of imports for the four
        priority crops. For a top score, a country must have clear and comprehensive seed import processes that
        are enforced consistently. For a score of 6 to less than 8, import processes are clear to seed producers/
        companies and regulatory agencies, but they are not always followed consistently. Scores between 4
        to less than 6 indicate that import processes are not clear to seed producers/companies and regulatory
        agencies and that they are not followed consistently. Scores between 2 and less than 4 indicate that there
        are no formal seed regulations that define procedures for seed trade. In countries with a score of 0 to less
        than 2, import processes are only partially defined and hence cannot be followed. A country that does not
        have a formal process for seed imports scores 0.</p>
