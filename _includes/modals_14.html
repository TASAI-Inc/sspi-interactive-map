                          <p>This indicator tracks the status of FMSS-compliant national seed policy instruments (seed policy, law,
                            regulations and decrees) and institutional arrangements that encourage private sector/community
                            participation in seed sector development. For a top score, a country should have a seed policy or strategy
                            that recognizes and promotes FMSS, as well as a stand-alone legislative or regulatory instrument on FMSS.
                            For a score of 6 to less than 8, countries should recognize FMSS in policy instruments and promote some
                            of their aspects. In countries scoring 4 to less than 6, FMSS are recognized in policy instruments, but
                            minimal actual support is provided to these systems. For a score of 2 to less than 4, FMSS are recognized
                            in policy instruments and minimal support is provided. A score of 0 to less than 2 indicates that the policy
                            instruments that recognize FMSS are in draft form and FMSS receive minimal support. A country whose
                            seed policy instruments do not recognize FMSS scores 0.
