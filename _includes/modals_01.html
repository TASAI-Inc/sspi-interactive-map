              <p> This indicator is based on expert opinion on the quality of the variety release and registration process
                in terms of its clarity to breeders and to the regulatory authorities, and the consistency with which the
                process is followed. A typical country with a high score would have a functioning variety release system
                that is clearly defined, with procedures that are consistently followed and clearly understood by public
                and private breeders. The system has a standard cost structure, and the national variety catalogue is
                regularly updated. For countries with a score of 6 to less than 8, the variety release process is clear to
                breeders and the regulatory agency, but it is not followed consistently. For countries scoring 4 to less
                than 6, the variety release process is clear to breeders and the regulatory agency, but it is not followed
                consistently. For a score of 2 to less than 4, the variety release process exists, but is not clear to breeders
                or the regulatory agency and it is not followed consistently. In countries with a score of 0 to less than 2,
                a variety release process exists, but it is not followed. A country that does not have a variety release and
                registration process scores 0.</p>
