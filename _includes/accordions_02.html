                This indicator tracks the number of varieties of the top four priority cereal and legume food security crops4 released in the last 3 years, offering a good measure of outputs from the variety development and release system. More varieties released often translates to more varieties commercialized, thereby increasing farmers' choice. Data sources are national variety catalogues and regional variety catalogues.
