              <p> This indicator assesses the performance of the national seed trade association. The scoring is based on
                six performance areas, each scored on a scale of 0 to 10: (i) activity on important seed sector issues, (ii)
                democracy and governance, (iii) effectiveness in advocacy, (iv) managerial ability, (v) provision of value to
                members, and (vi) ability to mobilize resources. Each area was assigned an opinion score by the country
                expert, who had reviewed the profile of the association, its management and governance structures, and
                examples of its recent activities and achievements. The overall indicator score is the average of scores
                for the six performance areas. For a top score, the national seed association should score highly in each
                of the 6 performance areas.</p>
