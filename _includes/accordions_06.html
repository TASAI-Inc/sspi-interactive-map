        This is a quantitative variable capturing the number of varieties that are sold to farmers. Two approaches
        were considered for scoring this indicator. First was a “distance to frontier” method, which would assign 0
        for no varieties sold and 10 to the best performing country (Table 6). However, on closer analysis of the data,
        this approach was dropped because, with 1,592 varieties sold, the top preforming country was an extreme
        outlier. Moreover, this approach would be highly sensitive to the frontier score which can vary significantly
        across the years. Instead, similarly to indicator 2, we opted for a four-tier scoring system shown in Table
        6, where a linear relationship is assumed between the number of varieties sold and the score within the
        ranges 1 to 100 and 100 to 200. This approach was chosen as it best captures the stages of seed sector
        growth. A possible drawback of this method is that the brackets may need to be reviewed in subsequent
        reports, if the number of varieties changes significantly across many countries.</p>
