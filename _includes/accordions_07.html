        This indicator tracks the utilization of quality commercial seed by farmers. For each crop, we use the
        volume of available commercial seed (calculated as local seed production, plus imports, minus exports)
        as the numerator and the national seed requirement as the denominator. The denominator (national
        seed requirement) is calculated using either of two approaches: computed estimates or country-provided
        estimates, as described below.
