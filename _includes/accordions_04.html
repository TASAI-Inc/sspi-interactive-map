            <p>This indicator assesses the existence and functioning of a national program
                (which may include an institute, department, or agency) mandated to carry out or
                coordinate activities related to PGRFA. These activities include the management of
                any in-situ conservation area and/or ex-situ conservation facility, such as a national
                gene bank. The data sources for this indicator are the national entities mandated
                to coordinate PRGA activities (Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) 1997).
