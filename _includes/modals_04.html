                          <p>  This indicator assesses the existence and functioning of a national program (which may include an institute,
                            department, or agency) mandated to carry out or coordinate PGRFA activities. The indicator is based on
                            expert opinion. For a score between 8 and 10, a country should have an entity that has a specific mandate
                            to coordinate all matters of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture. This entity should also
                            manage the national gene bank and must be active in the collection, characterization, and conservation
                            of PGRFA. For a score of 6 to less than 8, a country should have a national program comprising several
                            institutions and a mechanism to coordinate national PGRFA activities and should be carrying out some of
                            the activities. Countries with a score of 4 to less than 6 have a national program that coordinates national
                            PGRFA activities, but it is not fully functional. Countries scoring between 2 and less than 4 do not have
                            a national program but do have a functioning committee or another mechanism to coordinate PGRFA
                            activities. A score of 0 to less than 2 indicates a that country does not have national program, but there is
                            a functioning committee or another mechanism to coordinate a few PGRFA activities. A country that does
                            not have any entity in charge of PGRFA activities scores 0.
