        This indicator measures whether a country has adopted national biosafety frameworks and if these
        frameworks are operational. A typical country with a high score (8 to 10) has a policy instrument to regulate
        biosafety, which is implemented. For a score of 6 to less than 8, the national biosafety framework is
        approved and most of its aspects are implemented. For a score of 4 to less than 6, the national biosafety
        framework is approved but only a few of its aspects are being implemented. For a score of 2 to less than
        4, the national biosafety framework is approved, but it has not been implemented. For a score of 0 to less
        than 2, the national biosafety framework is either in draft form, or is still being completed. A country with
        no biosafety framework scores 0.</p>
