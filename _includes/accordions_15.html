      <p>The indicator assesses the adequacy of the human resource capacity available for seed field inspections.
        The indicator is computed as an expert opinion on a scale of 0 to 10. The initial plan was for this to
        be a quantitative indicator calculated as the ratio of land area under seed cultivation to the number of
        inspectors. However, the preliminary results from this method did not seem to match a priori knowledge
        of the adequacy of seed inspectors in the countries. This was because this quantitative approach did not
        factor in issues such as the geographical distribution of seed lots, the available resources to support seed
        inspectors (e.g., vehicles, digital tools), and the number of registered inspectors who are not involved in
        seed inspection. Moreover, 11 of the 47 surveyed countries did not have data for either seed inspectors
        or land under seed inspection.</p>
      <p>In the absence of a suitable quantitative measure, expert opinion was used to generate the scores. We
        supplement the score with the number of public and private seed inspectors, wherever data are available.
        A country with a top score has a vibrant seed inspection service that effectively carries out its mandate in a
        timely and cost-effective manner. For a score of 6 to less than 8, seed inspection is relatively efficient, with
        a few aspects that do not work well. For a score of 4 to less than 6, the effectiveness of seed inspection services is constrained by a lack of personnel or facilities such as transportation. For a score of 2 to less than 4, seed inspection is severely hampered by a lack of inspectors and facilities. For a score of 0 to less
        than 2, seed inspection functions are barely carried out due to a lack of inspectors and facilities. A country
        with no seed inspectors scores 0.</p>
