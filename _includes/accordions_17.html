      <p> This indicator assesses the performance of the national seed trade association. The scoring is based on
        six performance areas, each scored on a scale of 0 to 10: (i) activity on important seed sector issues, (ii)
        democracy and governance, (iii) effectiveness in advocacy, (iv) managerial ability, (v) provision of value to
        members, and (vi) ability to mobilize resources. Each area was assigned an opinion score by the country
        expert, who had reviewed the profile of the association, its management and governance structures, and
        examples of its recent activities and achievements. The overall indicator score is the average of scores
        for the six performance areas. For a top score, the national seed association should score highly in each
        of the 6 performance areas.</p>
