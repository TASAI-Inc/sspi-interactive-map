      <p>This indicator measures the performance of the national seed trade association. It
        assumes that well-functioning national seed trade associations play a key role in
        developing a country's seed sector, as they represent the interests of the industry
        and are an important liaison between the government and private sector. Data
        sources are the national seed association, the national seed authority, and TASAI
        reports, where available.</p>
