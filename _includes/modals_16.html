                          <p>This indicator rates the adequacy of government efforts to combat counterfeit seed. The score represents
                            expert opinion on a scale of 0 to 10 and is based on an assessment of government measures to address
                            the proliferation of counterfeit seed and the presence of punitive measures in statutory instruments. To
                            receive a top score, a country should have fully enforced legal measures to combat the production and
                            sale of counterfeit seed. For a score of 6 to less than 8, the government has structured efforts to combat
                            counterfeit seed, and these efforts are often effective. For a score of 4 to less than 6, the government
                            has structured efforts to combat counterfeit seed, but these efforts are not always effective. A score of 2
                            to less than 4 indicates that the government has structured efforts to combat counterfeit seed, but these
                            efforts are largely ineffective. In countries with a score of 0 to 2, the government takes ad hoc initiatives
                            to combat counterfeit seed. A country where no efforts have been taken to combat the production and
                            sale of counterfeit seed scores 0.</p>
