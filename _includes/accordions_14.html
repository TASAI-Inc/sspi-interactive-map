      <p>This indicator tracks the extent to which national seed policy instruments (seed policies, laws, regulations and decrees) recognize FMSS and promote institutional
        arrangements that create an enabling environment for FMSS in seed sector development. Note that the indicator tracks the status of these instruments and not
        their implementation. Data sources are national seed authorities, and the Ministry of Agriculture.
