                in terms of its clarity to breeders and to the regulatory authorities, and the consistency with which the
                process is followed. A typical country with a high score would have a functioning variety release system
                that is clearly defined, with procedures that are consistently followed and clearly understood by public
                and private breeders. The system has a standard cost structure, and the national variety catalogue is

                breeders and the regulatory agency, but it is not followed consistently. For countries scoring 4 to less
                than 6, the variety release process is clear to breeders and the regulatory agency, but it is not followed
                consistently. For a score of 2 to less than 4, the variety release process exists, but is not clear to breeders

                the three years 2020-2022 for the four priority crops. Data for this indicator were sourced from the recent
                national/regional variety catalogues. Where the catalogues were not available, the data were obtained from
                the entity in charge of variety release in the country. Three approaches were considered for scoring this
                indicator. First was a “distance to frontier” approach that assigns a score of 0 to countries with no variety
                releases, and a score of 10 to the best performing country. However, on closer analysis of the data, this
                approach was dropped because the top preforming country was too much of an outlier, with 286 varieties
                released. Moreover, this approach is highly sensitive to the frontier score, which can vary significantly
                across the years. The second approach considered was normalizing the indicator based on total land under
                cultivation for each crop to calculate the number of varieties released per hectare. Again, this approach
                did not seem to suit the data, given the wide variation of agro-ecologies among countries. For example,
                some large countries with more uniform agro-ecologies require fewer varieties, while a small country
                with diverse agro-ecologies may require significantly more varieties. The last approach considered was a
                four-tier scoring system shown in Table 5, where a linear relationship is assumed between the number of
                varieties released and the score within the ranges 1 to 50 and 50 to 100. We selected this approach as it
                best captures the stages of seed sector growth over time.</p>

            <p> Responses to this indicator are based on expert opinion ratings on three aspects of national breeding
                programs for each of the priority crops: (i) adequacy of the number of breeders, (ii) adequacy of funding
                for breeding programs, and (iii) adequacy of basic research infrastructure, which enhances the ability of
                active breeders in public institutions6 to develop new varieties. The country score is the average of the
                twelve scores (three scores for each of the four crops). For a top score, a country should have national
                breeding programs with an adequate number of breeders for all priority crops, have adequate funding
                for breeding and variety development, and have adequate research facilities for breeding and variety
                development across all four priority crops. For countries with a score of 6 to less than 8, national breeding
                programs will typically have multiple, but overall, insufficient, breeders, as well as insufficient funding and
                basic breeding infrastructure. For a score of 4 to less than 6, the NARI's breeding programs lack breeders
                for some of the four priority crops, coupled with insufficient funding and a basic breeding infrastructure that
                needs rehabilitation or replacement. For countries scoring 2 to less than 4, NARI breeding programs have
                few breeders, funding that is not continuously available, and limited breeding infrastructure. For a score
                of 0 to less than 2, NARIs do not have breeding programs for all of their priority crops, have insufficient
                funding or no funding, and lack basic breeding infrastructure. A country with no breeding programs for
                any of the four priority crops scores 0.

                department, or agency) mandated to carry out or coordinate PGRFA activities. The indicator is based on
                expert opinion. For a score between 8 and 10, a country should have an entity that has a specific mandate
                to coordinate all matters of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture. This entity should also
                manage the national gene bank and must be active in the collection, characterization, and conservation
                of PGRFA. For a score of 6 to less than 8, a country should have a national program comprising several
                institutions and a mechanism to coordinate national PGRFA activities and should be carrying out some of
                the activities. Countries with a score of 4 to less than 6 have a national program that coordinates national
                PGRFA activities, but it is not fully functional. Countries scoring between 2 and less than 4 do not have
                a national program but do have a functioning committee or another mechanism to coordinate PGRFA
                activities. A score of 0 to less than 2 indicates a that country does not have national program, but there is

            <p>This indicator tracks the level of satisfaction with the availability of EGS (sometimes referred to as basic
                seed). The ratings measure satisfaction with the availability of EGS to meet certified seed production
                needs based on (i) the quantity of the EGS supplied, (ii) the quality of the EGS, and (iii) the timeliness of
                delivery of the EGS. The indicator is scored as an expert opinion indicator. In many cases, seed companies/
                producers access EGS from their NARIs. However, there are also other sources of EGS, such as CGIAR
                centers, private sector companies, and universities, among others. Since the primary purpose of this
                indicator is to measure a country's domestic EGS production capacity, countries that rely (extensively) on
                external sources of EGS may not score higher than 5/10, even if they source sufficient quantities of EGS.
                This does not apply to NARIs that collaborate with private EGS suppliers. In countries that received a top
                score, its NARIs and other EGS providers produce adequate quantities of quality EGS and deliver it on
                time to all entities that require it. In countries that received a score of 6 to less than 8, the NARIs and other
                EGS providers supply EGS continuously, the EGS is of reasonably good quality, and is mostly delivered
                on time. However, from time to time, the EGS suppliers are not able to meet the needs for EGS, causing
                bottlenecks in the system. In countries that received a score of 4 to less than 6, the NARIs and other
                EGS providers supply EGS continuously; however, the quantities produced barely meet certified seed
                production needs, the quality of the EGS is fair, and the delivery is frequently delayed. In countries that
                scored 2 to less than 4, the NARIs and other EGS providers supply limited quantities of EGS, often of poor
                quality, and delivery is often delayed. In countries that scored 0 to less than 2, the EGS supplied by the
                NARIs and other EGS providers is inadequate, of poor quality, and the delivery is hardly, if ever, on time.
                In countries where the NARIs do not produce EGS for the four priority crops, a score of 0 was assigned.
                However, some countries with weak breeding programs source EGS from NARIs in neighboring countries
                and/or from collaborating CGIAR centers and meet the demand for EGS through these channels. In such
                cases, countries scored higher than 0, recognizing the fact that, while local capacity to produce EGS is
                lacking, EGS is nevertheless available to seed producers in the country.</p>

        This is a quantitative variable capturing the number of varieties that are sold to farmers. Two approaches
        were considered for scoring this indicator. First was a “distance to frontier” method, which would assign 0
        for no varieties sold and 10 to the best performing country (Table 6). However, on closer analysis of the data,
        this approach was dropped because, with 1,592 varieties sold, the top preforming country was an extreme
        outlier. Moreover, this approach would be highly sensitive to the frontier score which can vary significantly
        across the years. Instead, similarly to indicator 2, we opted for a four-tier scoring system shown in Table
        6, where a linear relationship is assumed between the number of varieties sold and the score within the
        ranges 1 to 100 and 100 to 200. This approach was chosen as it best captures the stages of seed sector
        growth. A possible drawback of this method is that the brackets may need to be reviewed in subsequent
        reports, if the number of varieties changes significantly across many countries.</p>

        This indicator tracks the utilization of quality commercial seed by farmers. For each crop, we use the
        volume of available commercial seed (calculated as local seed production, plus imports, minus exports)
        as the numerator and the national seed requirement as the denominator. The denominator (national
        seed requirement) is calculated using either of two approaches: computed estimates or country-provided
        estimates, as described below.</p>

        agencies and that they are not followed consistently. Scores between 2 and less than 4 indicate that there
        are no formal seed regulations that define procedures for seed trade. In countries with a score of 0 to less

      <p> This indicator tracks the adequacy of the agro-dealer (or seed seller) network in a country. It only considers
        seed that has passed through a formal system of quality assurance recognized in the country in question.
        Initially, this indicator was to be based on a quantitative measure, computed as the ratio of the number
        of agro-dealers to number of agricultural households. Initial computations based on this method did not
        seem to reflect the adequacy of the agro-dealer network in the country, based on a priori information.
        This is because of the wide variation in the size and distribution of agro-dealers across the countries. In
        addition, 10 of the 47 countries were missing one or both of the data points needed for the calculation.
        Given these limitations, we opted to base the scores on expert opinion on a scale of 0 to 10. For a score
        between 8 and 10, a country should have a network of agro-dealers large enough to meet the needs
        of the country; agro-dealers should also reach all farming areas of the country. For a score of 6 to less
        than 8, the country typically has a relatively large network of agro-dealers, but most are located in urban
        areas. For a score of 4 to less than 6, the country usually has a reasonable network of agro-dealers, but
        the vast majority of agro-dealers are based in urban areas. Countries with a score of 2 to less than 4 have
        a poor network of agro-dealers, with most of them based in urban areas. For a score of 0 to less than 2,
        the country has a very poor network of agro-dealers, who are all in urban areas. Countries that have no
        agro-dealers score 0. Although the indicator is scored based on opinion, where available, we provide the
        number of agro-dealers in the results.</p>

      <p>The indicator assesses the percentage of seed sold in packages of 2 kg or less. The data point is the total
        volume of seed (for the seed-propagated crops) sold in small packages, expressed as a percentage of
        the total volume of seed produced (for the four crops). The percentage of seed sold in packages of 2 kg
        or less is then multiplied by 10 to generate a final score out of 10. Note that the volume of seed produced
        is used as a proxy for seed sales, and that vegetatively propagated crops such as potato, banana, and
        cassava are excluded from this calculation as they are not sold to farmers in small packages.</p>
      <p>There are several limitations to this method:
        • The 2 kg upper limit for a small package is not always appropriate. The 2 kg limit does not apply
        to all crops or to all countries. For example, in Egypt, the government has set 5 kg as the smallest
        package size as this fits the area of the average landholding for a smallholder Egyptian farmer. In addition, 2 kg may be little for some, but not all crops, depending on the seeding rate. The seeding
        rate varies widely depending on the crop in question, from 20 kg/ha for maize, to 200 kg/ha for
        wheat, implying that 2 kg of seed may not be appropriate to all smallholder farmers.
        • Data is mostly based on estimates. For countries where TASAI studies have not been conducted
        and this information has not been collected from seed producers, the responses are based on
        informed estimates from the national seed authorities.
        • The exclusion of vegetatively propagated crops from the calculation affects 10 countries, as their
        scores are not based on all four crops. Five of these countries selected two vegetatively propagated
        crops as priority crops.
        Despite the above limitations, this yardstick measure is still useful for many cases across Africa where
        smallholder farmers are the main producers of cereal and legume crops. For a country to have a top score,
        all the seed for the focus crops should be sold in packages of 2 kg or less. A country where none of the
        seed for the priority crops is sold in small packages of 2 kg or less scores 0.</p>

      <p>The indicator assesses the adequacy of the human resource capacity available for seed field inspections.
        The indicator is computed as an expert opinion on a scale of 0 to 10. The initial plan was for this to
        be a quantitative indicator calculated as the ratio of land area under seed cultivation to the number of
        inspectors. However, the preliminary results from this method did not seem to match a priori knowledge
        of the adequacy of seed inspectors in the countries. This was because this quantitative approach did not
        factor in issues such as the geographical distribution of seed lots, the available resources to support seed
        inspectors (e.g., vehicles, digital tools), and the number of registered inspectors who are not involved in
        seed inspection. Moreover, 11 of the 47 surveyed countries did not have data for either seed inspectors
        or land under seed inspection.</p>
      <p>In the absence of a suitable quantitative measure, expert opinion was used to generate the scores. We
        supplement the score with the number of public and private seed inspectors, wherever data are available.
        A country with a top score has a vibrant seed inspection service that effectively carries out its mandate in a
        timely and cost-effective manner. For a score of 6 to less than 8, seed inspection is relatively efficient, with
        a few aspects that do not work well. For a score of 4 to less than 6, the effectiveness of seed inspection services is constrained by a lack of personnel or facilities such as transportation. For a score of 2 to less than 4, seed inspection is severely hampered by a lack of inspectors and facilities. For a score of 0 to less
        than 2, seed inspection functions are barely carried out due to a lack of inspectors and facilities. A country
        with no seed inspectors scores 0.</p>

      <p>This indicator rates the adequacy of government efforts to combat counterfeit seed. The score represents
        expert opinion on a scale of 0 to 10 and is based on an assessment of government measures to address
        the proliferation of counterfeit seed and the presence of punitive measures in statutory instruments. To
        receive a top score, a country should have fully enforced legal measures to combat the production and
        sale of counterfeit seed. For a score of 6 to less than 8, the government has structured efforts to combat
        counterfeit seed, and these efforts are often effective. For a score of 4 to less than 6, the government
        has structured efforts to combat counterfeit seed, but these efforts are not always effective. A score of 2
        to less than 4 indicates that the government has structured efforts to combat counterfeit seed, but these
        efforts are largely ineffective. In countries with a score of 0 to 2, the government takes ad hoc initiatives
        to combat counterfeit seed. A country where no efforts have been taken to combat the production and
        sale of counterfeit seed scores 0.</p>

      <p> This indicator assesses the performance of the national seed trade association. The scoring is based on
        six performance areas, each scored on a scale of 0 to 10: (i) activity on important seed sector issues, (ii)
        democracy and governance, (iii) effectiveness in advocacy, (iv) managerial ability, (v) provision of value to
        members, and (vi) ability to mobilize resources. Each area was assigned an opinion score by the country
        expert, who had reviewed the profile of the association, its management and governance structures, and
        examples of its recent activities and achievements. The overall indicator score is the average of scores
        for the six performance areas. For a top score, the national seed association should score highly in each
        of the 6 performance areas.</p>

                in terms of its clarity to breeders and to the regulatory authorities, and the consistency with which the

                            <p>This indicator is a quantitative variable, capturing the total number of varieties registered or released in
                            the three years 2020-2022 for the four priority crops. Data for this indicator were sourced from the recent
                            national/regional variety catalogues. Where the catalogues were not available, the data were obtained from
                            the entity in charge of variety release in the country. Three approaches were considered for scoring this
                            indicator. First was a “distance to frontier” approach that assigns a score of 0 to countries with no variety
                            releases, and a score of 10 to the best performing country. However, on closer analysis of the data, this
                            approach was dropped because the top preforming country was too much of an outlier, with 286 varieties
                            released. Moreover, this approach is highly sensitive to the frontier score, which can vary significantly
                            across the years. The second approach considered was normalizing the indicator based on total land under
                            cultivation for each crop to calculate the number of varieties released per hectare. Again, this approach
                            did not seem to suit the data, given the wide variation of agro-ecologies among countries. For example,
                            some large countries with more uniform agro-ecologies require fewer varieties, while a small country
                            with diverse agro-ecologies may require significantly more varieties. The last approach considered was a
                            four-tier scoring system shown in Table 5, where a linear relationship is assumed between the number of
                            varieties released and the score within the ranges 1 to 50 and 50 to 100. We selected this approach as it
                            best captures the stages of seed sector growth over time.</p>

                          <p>  Responses to this indicator are based on expert opinion ratings on three aspects of national breeding
                            programs for each of the priority crops: (i) adequacy of the number of breeders, (ii) adequacy of funding
                            for breeding programs, and (iii) adequacy of basic research infrastructure, which enhances the ability of
                            active breeders in public institutions6 to develop new varieties. The country score is the average of the
                            twelve scores (three scores for each of the four crops). For a top score, a country should have national
                            breeding programs with an adequate number of breeders for all priority crops, have adequate funding
                            for breeding and variety development, and have adequate research facilities for breeding and variety
                            development across all four priority crops. For countries with a score of 6 to less than 8, national breeding
                            programs will typically have multiple, but overall, insufficient, breeders, as well as insufficient funding and
                            basic breeding infrastructure. For a score of 4 to less than 6, the NARI's breeding programs lack breeders
                            for some of the four priority crops, coupled with insufficient funding and a basic breeding infrastructure that
                            needs rehabilitation or replacement. For countries scoring 2 to less than 4, NARI breeding programs have
                            few breeders, funding that is not continuously available, and limited breeding infrastructure. For a score
                            of 0 to less than 2, NARIs do not have breeding programs for all of their priority crops, have insufficient
                            funding or no funding, and lack basic breeding infrastructure. A country with no breeding programs for
                            any of the four priority crops scores 0.

                            expert opinion. For a score between 8 and 10, a country should have an entity that has a specific mandate
                            to coordinate all matters of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture. This entity should also
                            manage the national gene bank and must be active in the collection, characterization, and conservation
                            of PGRFA. For a score of 6 to less than 8, a country should have a national program comprising several
                            institutions and a mechanism to coordinate national PGRFA activities and should be carrying out some of
                            the activities. Countries with a score of 4 to less than 6 have a national program that coordinates national
                            PGRFA activities, but it is not fully functional. Countries scoring between 2 and less than 4 do not have

                            a functioning committee or another mechanism to coordinate a few PGRFA activities. A country that does
                            not have any entity in charge of PGRFA activities scores 0.

              <p>This indicator tracks the level of satisfaction with the availability of EGS (sometimes referred to as basic
                seed). The ratings measure satisfaction with the availability of EGS to meet certified seed production
                needs based on (i) the quantity of the EGS supplied, (ii) the quality of the EGS, and (iii) the timeliness of
                delivery of the EGS. The indicator is scored as an expert opinion indicator. In many cases, seed companies/
                producers access EGS from their NARIs. However, there are also other sources of EGS, such as CGIAR
                centers, private sector companies, and universities, among others. Since the primary purpose of this
                indicator is to measure a country's domestic EGS production capacity, countries that rely (extensively) on
                external sources of EGS may not score higher than 5/10, even if they source sufficient quantities of EGS.
                This does not apply to NARIs that collaborate with private EGS suppliers. In countries that received a top
                score, its NARIs and other EGS providers produce adequate quantities of quality EGS and deliver it on
                time to all entities that require it. In countries that received a score of 6 to less than 8, the NARIs and other
                EGS providers supply EGS continuously, the EGS is of reasonably good quality, and is mostly delivered
                on time. However, from time to time, the EGS suppliers are not able to meet the needs for EGS, causing
                bottlenecks in the system. In countries that received a score of 4 to less than 6, the NARIs and other
                EGS providers supply EGS continuously; however, the quantities produced barely meet certified seed
                production needs, the quality of the EGS is fair, and the delivery is frequently delayed. In countries that
                scored 2 to less than 4, the NARIs and other EGS providers supply limited quantities of EGS, often of poor
                quality, and delivery is often delayed. In countries that scored 0 to less than 2, the EGS supplied by the
                NARIs and other EGS providers is inadequate, of poor quality, and the delivery is hardly, if ever, on time.
                In countries where the NARIs do not produce EGS for the four priority crops, a score of 0 was assigned.
                However, some countries with weak breeding programs source EGS from NARIs in neighboring countries
                and/or from collaborating CGIAR centers and meet the demand for EGS through these channels. In such
                cases, countries scored higher than 0, recognizing the fact that, while local capacity to produce EGS is
                lacking, EGS is nevertheless available to seed producers in the country.</p>

                This is a quantitative variable capturing the number of varieties that are sold to farmers. Two approaches
                were considered for scoring this indicator. First was a “distance to frontier” method, which would assign 0
                for no varieties sold and 10 to the best performing country (Table 6). However, on closer analysis of the data,
                this approach was dropped because, with 1,592 varieties sold, the top preforming country was an extreme
                outlier. Moreover, this approach would be highly sensitive to the frontier score which can vary significantly
                across the years. Instead, similarly to indicator 2, we opted for a four-tier scoring system shown in Table
                6, where a linear relationship is assumed between the number of varieties sold and the score within the
                ranges 1 to 100 and 100 to 200. This approach was chosen as it best captures the stages of seed sector
                growth. A possible drawback of this method is that the brackets may need to be reviewed in subsequent
                reports, if the number of varieties changes significantly across many countries.</p>

                            This indicator tracks the utilization of quality commercial seed by farmers. For each crop, we use the
                            volume of available commercial seed (calculated as local seed production, plus imports, minus exports)
                            as the numerator and the national seed requirement as the denominator. The denominator (national
                            seed requirement) is calculated using either of two approaches: computed estimates or country-provided
                            estimates, as described below.</p>

                            enforcement of import regulations.10 In addition, data were collected on the volume of imports for the four
                            priority crops. For a top score, a country must have clear and comprehensive seed import processes that
                            are enforced consistently. For a score of 6 to less than 8, import processes are clear to seed producers/
                            companies and regulatory agencies, but they are not always followed consistently. Scores between 4
                            to less than 6 indicate that import processes are not clear to seed producers/companies and regulatory
                            agencies and that they are not followed consistently. Scores between 2 and less than 4 indicate that there
                            are no formal seed regulations that define procedures for seed trade. In countries with a score of 0 to less
                            than 2, import processes are only partially defined and hence cannot be followed. A country that does not
                            have a formal process for seed imports scores 0.</p>

                          <p>  This indicator tracks the adequacy of the agro-dealer (or seed seller) network in a country. It only considers
                            seed that has passed through a formal system of quality assurance recognized in the country in question.
                            Initially, this indicator was to be based on a quantitative measure, computed as the ratio of the number
                            of agro-dealers to number of agricultural households. Initial computations based on this method did not
                            seem to reflect the adequacy of the agro-dealer network in the country, based on a priori information.
                            This is because of the wide variation in the size and distribution of agro-dealers across the countries. In
                            addition, 10 of the 47 countries were missing one or both of the data points needed for the calculation.
                            Given these limitations, we opted to base the scores on expert opinion on a scale of 0 to 10. For a score
                            between 8 and 10, a country should have a network of agro-dealers large enough to meet the needs
                            of the country; agro-dealers should also reach all farming areas of the country. For a score of 6 to less
                            than 8, the country typically has a relatively large network of agro-dealers, but most are located in urban
                            areas. For a score of 4 to less than 6, the country usually has a reasonable network of agro-dealers, but
                            the vast majority of agro-dealers are based in urban areas. Countries with a score of 2 to less than 4 have
                            a poor network of agro-dealers, with most of them based in urban areas. For a score of 0 to less than 2,
                            the country has a very poor network of agro-dealers, who are all in urban areas. Countries that have no
                            agro-dealers score 0. Although the indicator is scored based on opinion, where available, we provide the
                            number of agro-dealers in the results.</p>

                            the total volume of seed produced (for the four crops). The percentage of seed sold in packages of 2 kg
                            or less is then multiplied by 10 to generate a final score out of 10. Note that the volume of seed produced
                            is used as a proxy for seed sales, and that vegetatively propagated crops such as potato, banana, and
                            cassava are excluded from this calculation as they are not sold to farmers in small packages.</p>
                            <p>There are several limitations to this method:
                              • The 2 kg upper limit for a small package is not always appropriate. The 2 kg limit does not apply
                              to all crops or to all countries. For example, in Egypt, the government has set 5 kg as the smallest
                              package size as this fits the area of the average landholding for a smallholder Egyptian farmer. In addition, 2 kg may be little for some, but not all crops, depending on the seeding rate. The seeding
                              rate varies widely depending on the crop in question, from 20 kg/ha for maize, to 200 kg/ha for
                              wheat, implying that 2 kg of seed may not be appropriate to all smallholder farmers.

                              and this information has not been collected from seed producers, the responses are based on
                              informed estimates from the national seed authorities.
                              • The exclusion of vegetatively propagated crops from the calculation affects 10 countries, as their
                              scores are not based on all four crops. Five of these countries selected two vegetatively propagated
                              crops as priority crops.
                              Despite the above limitations, this yardstick measure is still useful for many cases across Africa where
                              smallholder farmers are the main producers of cereal and legume crops. For a country to have a top score,
                              all the seed for the focus crops should be sold in packages of 2 kg or less. A country where none of the
                              seed for the priority crops is sold in small packages of 2 kg or less scores 0.</p>

                            and given a rating from 0 to 10. For a country to achieve a score of 8 to 10, all relevant policy instruments
                            should have been enacted by the relevant government entities. A score of 6 to less than 8 indicates that
                            most seed policy instruments are in place and that they are up to date. For a score of 4 to less than 6, a
                            fair number of seed policy instruments must be in place. For a score of 2 to less than 4, insufficient policy
                            instruments are in place, which may, moreover, be outdated. For a score of 0 to less than 2, seed policy
                            instruments are in draft mode. A country with no seed policy instruments at all scores 0.</p>

                the Economic Community for West African States (ECOWAS)11, and the Southern African Development
                Community (SADC)12. Seed industry experts' ratings are strictly informed by the status of alignment, since
                the specifics of the process vary by REC. For example, in the ECOWAS region, a country with a top score
                would have either adopted the ECOWAS Seed Regulations as their national seed regulations or the country
                would have passed ministerial orders in response to the various clauses in the ECOWAS Seed Regulations
                (ECOWAS 2008). Ministerial orders might deal with setting up a national seed fund, establishing a national
                seed committee, decreeing the process for seed importation and exportation or for the registration of seed
                producers, among other areas. In the COMESA region, a country with a top score would have aligned its
                national regulations with the COMESA Seed Trade Harmonization Regulations in three key areas - the
                COMESA certification system, variety release system, and the Quarantine and Phytosanitary measures
                (COMESA 2014). In the SADC region, a country should have signed the Memorandum of Understanding

                For a top score, harmonization is complete and is being implemented. For a score of 6 to less than 8,
                harmonization is complete, but the instruments are yet to be adopted. For a score of 4 to less than 6
                harmonization is ongoing. For a score of 2 to less than 4, harmonization has been initiated and some
                steps have been taken. For a score of 0 to less than 2, harmonization has just started. A country that has
                not harmonized its national seed policy instruments scores 0.

                            frameworks are operational. A typical country with a high score (8 to 10) has a policy instrument to regulate
                            biosafety, which is implemented. For a score of 6 to less than 8, the national biosafety framework is
                            approved and most of its aspects are implemented. For a score of 4 to less than 6, the national biosafety
                            framework is approved but only a few of its aspects are being implemented. For a score of 2 to less than
                            4, the national biosafety framework is approved, but it has not been implemented. For a score of 0 to less
                            than 2, the national biosafety framework is either in draft form, or is still being completed. A country with
                            no biosafety framework scores 0.</p>

                            For a score of 6 to less than 8, countries should recognize FMSS in policy instruments and promote some
                            of their aspects. In countries scoring 4 to less than 6, FMSS are recognized in policy instruments, but
                            minimal actual support is provided to these systems. For a score of 2 to less than 4, FMSS are recognized
                            in policy instruments and minimal support is provided. A score of 0 to less than 2 indicates that the policy

                The indicator is computed as an expert opinion on a scale of 0 to 10. The initial plan was for this to
                be a quantitative indicator calculated as the ratio of land area under seed cultivation to the number of
                inspectors. However, the preliminary results from this method did not seem to match a priori knowledge
                of the adequacy of seed inspectors in the countries. This was because this quantitative approach did not
                factor in issues such as the geographical distribution of seed lots, the available resources to support seed
                inspectors (e.g., vehicles, digital tools), and the number of registered inspectors who are not involved in
                seed inspection. Moreover, 11 of the 47 surveyed countries did not have data for either seed inspectors
                or land under seed inspection.</p>
                <p>In the absence of a suitable quantitative measure, expert opinion was used to generate the scores. We
                  supplement the score with the number of public and private seed inspectors, wherever data are available.
                  A country with a top score has a vibrant seed inspection service that effectively carries out its mandate in a
                  timely and cost-effective manner. For a score of 6 to less than 8, seed inspection is relatively efficient, with
                  a few aspects that do not work well. For a score of 4 to less than 6, the effectiveness of seed inspection services is constrained by a lack of personnel or facilities such as transportation. For a score of 2 to less than 4, seed inspection is severely hampered by a lack of inspectors and facilities. For a score of 0 to less
                  than 2, seed inspection functions are barely carried out due to a lack of inspectors and facilities. A country
                  with no seed inspectors scores 0.</p>

                            the proliferation of counterfeit seed and the presence of punitive measures in statutory instruments. To
                            receive a top score, a country should have fully enforced legal measures to combat the production and

                            counterfeit seed, and these efforts are often effective. For a score of 4 to less than 6, the government
                            has structured efforts to combat counterfeit seed, but these efforts are not always effective. A score of 2

              <p> This indicator assesses the performance of the national seed trade association. The scoring is based on
                six performance areas, each scored on a scale of 0 to 10: (i) activity on important seed sector issues, (ii)
                democracy and governance, (iii) effectiveness in advocacy, (iv) managerial ability, (v) provision of value to
                members, and (vi) ability to mobilize resources. Each area was assigned an opinion score by the country
                expert, who had reviewed the profile of the association, its management and governance structures, and
                examples of its recent activities and achievements. The overall indicator score is the average of scores
                for the six performance areas. For a top score, the national seed association should score highly in each
                of the 6 performance areas.</p>
